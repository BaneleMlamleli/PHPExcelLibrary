# PHPExcelLibrary
Testing the deprecated PHPExcel library. Reading, writing and other basic functionalities done on excel. I will also read data from the database and write to the excel sheet and vice versa
This library is no longer used, it is replaced by PHPSpreadsheet. https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel
